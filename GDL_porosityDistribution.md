## Outstanding Features<a name="feats"></a>

'''
GDL porosity optimization by simulation or experiment to obtain homogeneous distribution of current density, liquid water (saturation, volume fraction etc.) or larger power output
'''

* `much`, easier to do experiment validation(for some kind of distribution function)

* `much`, more convenience for further theory analysis of effect

* `maybe`, the potential to connect with AI algorithm on optimization field

## To be prefect<a name="yourwork"></a>

* `less`, less researches on 3D, multi phase condition (e.g. considerations with liquid water often use a 2D or 1D model)'

* `no`, no focus on the better usage of experimental data (e.g. data-drive technology)

* `little`, little focus on the accomplished change while changing the porosity distribution such as the change of compression pressure on the top of GDL (most mainly focus on the change of current density, the oxygen mole concentration etc.)

* `less`, less focus on the method of optimization: e.g. most only compare different combinations of simulation or experimental groups by specific standards to obtain the optimal solution

* `no`, no researches on the cross-scale study (e.g nano-scale with millimeter-micron scale, Lattice Boltzmann VS fluent/Comsol)
[Note 2019/3/15: referring to the two theory declarations by Einstein, check the existed theory or explanations]

* `no`, no researches on the combination of Micro-PLV or the technical experimental method with the simulation or theory prediction
