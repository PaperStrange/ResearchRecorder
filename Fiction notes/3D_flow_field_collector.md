有价值的规律 |
规律1 | temperature | Since both the electrochemical reaction kinetics and membrane conductivity can be improved at higher temperatures, operating the cell at the highest possible temperature while maintaining the membrane durability is critical to achieve better performance, and therefore the normal operating temperature for PEMFC is usually controlled at about 80 degree celsius.
规律2 | temperature | the water vapour becomes more and more unsaturated as temperature is increased, leading to the decrease in equilibrium water content. The drying out of the ionomer at elevated temperature suggests that the membrane needs to be better hydrated at higher temperature.
规律3 | temperature and pressure | Generally, increasing the operating temperature and decreasing the operating pressure may all reduce the amount of liquid water formation, and vice versa [1,2].
规律4 | pressure | It might be also possible to run the anode and cathode at different pressures to accelerate the water permeation from the cathode to anode through the membrane. However, much larger pressure differential is required by comparing to pressurizing the water to the cooling channel, and therefore the mechanical strength of the MEA needs to be carefully evaluated.
规律5 | current density | PEMFC at high current density operation is of particular interest to vehicular applications for obtaining high power density, as long as with sufficient fuel and oxidant supply.

有价值的规律 |
规律1 | concept | The non-frozen water in ionomer can also be classified into surface and bulk water [73,74], or vapour and liquid [75-77]. Surface water strongly interacts with H+SO3- and is mostly likely present close to the charged sites SO3-[78]. Bulk water is mainly identified as liquid which are loosely bound to SO3-.
规律2 | PEM | The vibration of the polymer side chains enhances the proton transport, explaining why the polymer membranes exhibit higher proton conductivity than most of the other solid proton conductors (without vibration of the polymer side chains) (e.g. ceramics).
规律3 | PEM | When the amount of water is higher than the percolation threshold, the dominating proton transport mechanisms are the vehicle and hopping mechanisms. It has been reported that for intermediate and low hydration levels, the vehicle mechanism still dominates the proton transport, and for water content higher than 13, the hopping mechanism dominates [97-100].
规律4 | PEM | In the CL and at the interface between the CL and membrane, both the liquid water and vapour can be desorbed or absorbed by the ionomer to or from the pore regions of CL.
规律5 | PEM | due to the fact that water is not produced in anode and the EOD effect dries out the anode
规律6 | PEM | On the other hand, the EOD effect also causes drying out of the portions of membrane close to the anode side, resulting unevenly distributed water across the membrane and large ohmic loss close to the anode side
规律7 | GDL, CL | liquid water blocks the porous pathways in CL and GDL thus causing hindered oxygen transport to the reaction sites, such water flooding phenomenon is perceived as the chief mechanism leading to the “concentration or mass transport loss”, furthermore, the limiting current behaviour in the cell performance, and this is the reason that the carbon paper or carbon cloth is usually treated to be hydrophobic by coating a layer of PTFE on them to expel water.
规律8 | GDL, several magnitudes of criteria number | the Reynolds number (inertia force divided by viscous force)--Re--is calculated to be 10^(-2)~10^(-3), the Capillary number (viscous force divided by surface tension)--Ca-- is calculated to be 10^(-7)~10^(-8), the Weber number (inertia force divided by surface tension)--We-- is calculated to be 10^(-10), the Bond number (gravitational force divided by surface tension)--Bo-- is calculated to be 10^(-3)~10^(-4), the dimensionless number accounting for mass transport capability during condensation/evaporation--Sh_{ce}--is calculated to be 10^(-3)~10^(-1).
规律9 | capillary pressures | It can be noticed that negative capillary pressures (liquid water pressure is higher than gas pressure) are obtained because the GDL and CL are all hydrophobic.
规律10 | condensation and evaporation rates | However, the values of gamma_{cond} and gamma_{evap} from 1.0 to 10^(-4) s^(-1) have all been used in the previous studies [80,140]. Since the water phase change rates are strongly affected by the local conditions such as mass and heat transfer, the accuracy of the mass transfer rate of phase change calculations on the macroscopic level remains debated.
规律11 | CL, several magnitudes of criteria number | The Knudsen numbers (Kn_{g} and Kn_{lq}) can be calculated [142] as 10, 10^(-2) respectively 
规律12 | CL | It has been observed that the amounts of water absorption from liquid water and from saturated vapour are not the same (from liquid water is higher than from saturated vapour).
规律13 | CL | Evidence suggests that the PFSA polymer membrane surface is strongly hydrophobic when it is in contact with water vapour (whether saturated or not), and it becomes hydrophilic when in contact with liquid water. Water absorption from the vapour phase involves water condensation on the hydrophobic surface, leading to less water uptake.
规律14 | CL | It should be mentioned that the humidification of the ionomer is a very slow process, especially with water vapour.
规律15 | Channel | The flow in flow channel is convection dominated, and the driving force is the pressure at the flow channel inlets.
规律16 | Channel, several magnitudes of criteria number | The Re can be calculated [142] as 10^(2), Ca, We, Bo, which represent inertia force, viscous force, surface tension (as well as wall adhesion) and gravitational force, all need to be accounted.
规律17 | Channel | In fact, to facilitate liquid water removal in flow channel, the channel walls can be modified to be hydrophobic to minimize thewall adhesion effect.
规律18 | General | The transport of water in the ionomer of membrane and CL involves diffusion, EOD and hydraulic permeation, and it is largely coupled with proton transport. In the pores of GDL and CL and in flow channel, the transport of water vapour involves diffusion and convection. The capillary force alsoplays an important role in liquidwater transport in the pores of GDL and CL. The Knudsen diffusion can be neglected in the pores of GDL and in flow channel, but needs to be considered in the much smaller pores of CL. Phase change processes take place until the equilibrium states are achieved. However, as mentioned in Section 2.5, whether phase equilibriums of water exist remain debated because of the presence and arbitrary transport of liquid water, especially in the heterogeneous structures of CL and GDL.
规律19 | GDL, Cl | A hydrophobic surface is simply more effective in facilitating liquid transport than a hydrophilic surface due to the reduced contact area between liquid and wall. This is why that the GDL and CL are usually treated to be hydrophobic by adding PTFE to them to expel water.
规律20 | concept | The contact angle can be considered as a measure of the surface wettability
