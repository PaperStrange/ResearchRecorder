规律1 | temperature | Since both the electrochemical reaction kinetics and membrane conductivity can be improved at higher temperatures, operating the cell at the highest possible temperature while maintaining the membrane durability is critical to achieve better performance, and therefore the normal operating temperature for PEMFC is usually controlled at about 80 degree celsius.
规律2 | temperature | the water vapour becomes more and more unsaturated as temperature is increased, leading to the decrease in equilibrium water content. The drying out of the ionomer at elevated temperature suggests that the membrane needs to be better hydrated at higher temperature.
规律3 | temperature and pressure | Generally, increasing the operating temperature and decreasing the operating pressure may all reduce the amount of liquid water formation, and vice versa [1,2].
规律4 | pressure | It might be also possible to run the anode and cathode at different pressures to accelerate the water permeation from the cathode to anode through the membrane. However, much larger pressure differential is required by comparing to pressurizing the water to the cooling channel, and therefore the mechanical strength of the MEA needs to be carefully evaluated.

有价值的规律 |
规律1 | concept, PEM | The non-frozen water in ionomer can also be classified into surface and bulk water [73,74], or vapour and liquid [75-77]. Surface water strongly interacts with H+SO3- and is mostly likely present close to the charged sites SO3-[78]. Bulk water is mainly identified as liquid which are loosely bound to SO3-.
 规律2 | transport, PEM | The vibration of the polymer side chains enhances the proton transport, explaining why the polymer membranes exhibit higher proton conductivity than most of the other solid proton conductors (without vibration of the polymer side chains) (e.g. ceramics).
 规律3 | transport, PEM | When the amount of water is higher than the percolation threshold, the dominating proton transport mechanisms are the vehicle and hopping mechanisms. It has been reported that for intermediate and low hydration levels, the vehicle mechanism still dominates the proton transport, and for water content higher than 13, the hopping mechanism dominates [97-100].
 规律4 | transport, CL | In the CL and at the interface between the CL and membrane, both the liquid water and vapour can be desorbed or absorbed by the ionomer to or from the pore regions of CL.
 规律5 | transport, CL | due to the fact that water is not produced in anode and the EOD effect dries out the anode
